                    <p> To start off - well done for finding this. The page you are currently on displays all my thoughts, and i might as well write them down here. </p>
                    <p> As you read this, you may realise i am not the type of person you think i am. Nor do i expect you to completely change your opinion on me. But hey ho - it is what it is. </p> <br>
                    <p> As of right now i have no proper way to make this so it's just basic, but i'll improve it in the future. Happy reading! </p>

                    <p> This is my first entry, i guess this is more of a diary than an autobiography, but whatever. It doesnt really matter. To be fair, i've never done anything like this before, but i thought it could be a good idea. I might as well make a list of the people who i hold close, and truly care about.</p> <br>
                    <p> - My immediate family (duh) </p>
                    <p> - Eric, Max and Wezzo </p>
                    <p> - Toastlers </p> <br>
                    <p> And thats about it. When i say 'hold close', i really mean people i truly care for. Not like a mere friend, but true friends and people i can really trust. It's not that extensive of a list, but its a list nontheless. I guess i might as well introduce myself if i ever read this in the future. I currently way around 90kg, a mix of muscle and fat, bear in mind, and i stand at 5'8, nothing too great but meh. I am 14 and have a pet cat, Lorna, and a pet bearded dragon, Genji. Genji is more-so my pet, and i still love him, even though he doesnt do much. I appreciate looking after any creature - big or small. </p> <br>
                    <p> Surprising to most people, i try to consider my self a stoic, i think its called. When something happens that is unfortunate, i just move on. But i didnt always act like this. In my earlier years, i would act rashly and not care for much. Since then i have really changed my outlook on life. Now i appreciate the smaller things, and i have new hobbies. Guitar, for example. Aswell as this i have a burning passion for the seas. I don't know why, maybe because i just started playing Sea of Thieves, and that game has had an impact on me.</p> <br>
                    <p> You might think its silly. A game having an influencial impact on my life? Stupid, right? Well i dont think so. Since i started playing Sea of Theives, and appreciating those late nights i have with my friends playing the game, and the beautiful music i associate with it, i have found myself seeking a more forfilling life. Even the smallest of things, like the song Becalmed, is influencal to me. The simple chords with a beautiful melody really strikes something in me. I dont know why, but it does - and thats that. But its not just sea of Thieves </p> <br>
                    <p> Music is a really important part of my life, and it doesnt just influence me, it changes the way i act drastically. The calmer songs are what i appreciate most. Minecraft songs, rain world songs, and sea of thieves songs. A thing i would like to note is that all three of those games have a place in my heart. Minecraft, a game i played with my dad, when i was younger. Building fantastic castles and having fun really just doesnt stay long does it? Making fun little builds with my mum really was fun. Playing for hours with my little brother will never be forgotton. That's why Minecraft is important to me. Next - Rain world. Rain World is fantastic. The story is beautiful. The atmosphere makes me tear up. The pure idea of accention after a long loop of cycles is really soothing, you know? Rain world changed me alot, too, as the fun times i have had playing with other communities, mixed with the creative influence it has had on me and the way i think. The gradual progression of the story line as the characters continue is fascinating - a truly unique idea that not many people see the beauty of. I could write for hours about Rain world, but now its time for one of the most influencial games to me. </p> <br>
                    <p> Sea of thieves is absolutely beautiful. Here's why. It may seem simple at first glance, just sailing the seas and plundering for loot, yeah yeah yeah. But that's not why i like it. In the game you and your crew can play shanties, like Becalmed, which i mentioned earlier. This is fantastic to me, the idea of just watching the sun set whilst playing a soothing tune really makes me emotional. There are multiple storylines, scattered about throught the seas in the form of journals. In a way, thats what inspired me to make this right now. That, and the fact that i have a spare domain with my entire name on it, so i might as well use it. Anyway, the reason i love sea of thieves so much is divided, but they link up in some ways. Number 1 is the community and beauty around it. Many people with similar passions and ideas are around you, and it is always great to have a chat. Number 2, a specific storyline. It's so fantastic it needs its own paragraph </p> <br>
                    <p> Glitterbeard is a real person, nicknamed after his great beard, i'd suppose. He worked on Sea of Thieves and passed away due to cancer. This is quite sad in its self, but it gets really sad, in a beautiful way. In honor of this, Rare (The people who made sea of thieves), built him his own storyline. Many journals can be found throughout the game, and not even i have obtained them all yet, about Glitterbeard. He crashes onto an island blah blah blah, but heres the main part i care about. He gets ill, and he knows he will die. So, he goes to the highest peak, Plunder Valley, and builds a hideaway with his last moments. I'll speak aout that in a second, for the important part to me is the fact he laced the tree outside his hideaway with bottles. In the game, we have established you can play music, but with another crew the music gets an extra backing track. 8 players need to surround the tree, all holding their instruments. 2 men must hold their Hurdy Gurdies, 2 must have Drums, 2 must have the Concertinas and 2 must hold Banjos. The Hurdy Gurdies start, followed by the Concertinas, then Banjos, then Drums. This creates a fantastic song. Here's the real thing that tears me up. This music must be played at sunset, which brings an element of closure to it all - i'll expand on that in a minuit. As the song starts, the bottles light up and the floor shines a brilliant yellow. Aswell as this, an additional background noise is added, as this is a special thing Rare added, so they can do cool stuff like that, and a vocal noise. The singing is beautiful and great. </p> <br>
                    <p> At the end of the song, the sun has set, the music comes to a slow fade, and the doors open. Inside, the remains of Glitterbeard lay, a single skeleton clutching onto a notebook. Upon reading the book, you see that it was meant for his kids and wife, and he says his final goodbyes. I genuinely cried at this moment, and im not kidding. It was spectacular. You may be reading this and laughing it off, as a little emotional moment, but no. This is beautiful and true art. This is what should be considered art - the amount of emotion i felt was abnormally strong. The sunset, indicating the end of the day, and the end of this man's life, spent beautifully. This notebook is his final one, as is to be expected, but i love it. This is the way i want to die. I don't want to be buried, I want people to read what I write and i want to be sent off into the ocean, with a flaming canoe. Illegal? Yes. Do i care? No. This isnt about any spiritual stuff, this is about closure, and the end of me. I would like to give back. Who knows? Maybe some fish will eat me - I dont really care. This is all just from one game, Sea of Thieves. It has influenced me to the point where even though i play it less now, it still changes me. I fall asleep to the music, and it's just too beautiful to not. </p> <br>
                    <p> Not many people see things the way i do. Or, not that i know of anyway. Most people i know would genuinely just dismiss my views, after all why would they care. This is the part that annoys me. Some people don't see me the way i really am. Some of my friends think i am some sort of idiot who knows nothing. They will never be my true friends. People like Baloo think i try to act tough. I dont try to act tough, I try and be happy. It annoys me to the point of pure anger. However, some people in my life are great, like my family. Sometimes my parents can be shouty but whatever, they do lots for me. Even the fires we have outside mean so much to me. Fire is beautiful. Linking back to sea of thieves (as this seems to always do), i realise that my love for fire has started with our tradition of sending out our ship ablaze at the end of the night. A metaphor? Maybe. Who knows. Anyway - The fires i have with my parents are what i hold closest in my life. Pure happiness to me. Unless its on a school night, but even then it's still fantastic. Playing the guitar then is my favorite thing ever. Now just do that in wales and its truly my favorite thing ever. </p> <br>
                    <p> Anyway, i must go to bed now. I have been doing this for half an hour and i loved it, but i also love sleep. Ill be sure to update this at some point. Maybe tomorrow, who knows. Anyway, that's it for now. Bye bye. (23:05)</p>
